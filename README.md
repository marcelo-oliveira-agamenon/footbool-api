# Football API

Create with React App npx tool, for a fictional football application.
Note that we need to create a .env file with some variables such as port and endpoint from API.
We used this endpoint: [Football API](https://v3.football.api-sports.io), also add a port to run the application.

## How to run the application

- We're using docker to create a container for it, so we need to use this command:

```sh
docker compose up
```

- Then, we can access the localhost and port assigned!
